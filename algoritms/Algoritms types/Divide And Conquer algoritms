<!-- Merge Sort:

Divide: Split the unsorted list into two halves.
Conquer: Recursively sort each half.
Combine: Merge the sorted halves to produce a single sorted list.
Quick Sort:

Divide: Choose a pivot element and partition the array into two subarrays such that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
Conquer: Recursively sort the two subarrays.
Combine: No explicit combine step is needed; the array is sorted in-place.
Binary Search:

Divide: Compare the middle element of the sorted array with the target value.
Conquer: If the middle element is equal to the target, return its index. If it's less, recursively search the right half; otherwise, search the left half.
Combine: No explicit combine step is needed; the result is obtained when the target element is found or determined to be absent.
Strassen's Matrix Multiplication:

Divide: Split two matrices into four smaller matrices.
Conquer: Recursively compute seven products involving these smaller matrices.
Combine: Combine the seven products to obtain the final result efficiently.
Closest Pair of Points:

Divide: Divide the set of points into two equal-sized subsets based on their x-coordinates.
Conquer: Recursively find the closest pairs in both subsets.
Combine: Find the closest pair that spans the boundary between the two subsets and compare it with the closest pairs from the subsets.
Karatsuba Multiplication:

Divide: Split two multi-digit numbers into smaller parts.
Conquer: Recursively compute three multiplications of these smaller parts.
Combine: Combine the three results to obtain the final product efficiently.
Max Subarray Sum (Kadane's Algorithm):

Divide: Split the array into two subarrays.
Conquer: Find the maximum subarray sum recursively in both subarrays.
Combine: Calculate the maximum subarray sum that crosses the midpoint to find the overall maximum subarray sum. -->
